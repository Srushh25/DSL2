# Write a python program that computes the net amount of a bank
# account based a transaction log from console input.

# D 100 W 200 (Withdrawal is not allowed if balance is going
# negative. Write functions for withdraw and deposit) D means deposit
# while W means withdrawal.
# Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
# D 300 , D 300 , W 200 , D 100 ,
# Then, the output should be: 500
# ''')

# computes net bank amount based on the input
# "D" for deposit, "W" for withdrawal
